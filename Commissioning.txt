HOF5 Commissioning
==================

Connect to the network port on the PLC at 192.168.1.2.

Using the Texmate Development System, compile hof5.bas and open the
port to the PLC.


To confirm communication:
-------------------------
 - add User/UserVariables/TT01 to the watch window
 - turn the watch on
 - check that the value for TT01 from the PLC matches the value on the
   LED screen.


To modify the state of a valve:
-------------------------------
 - ensure that the plant is in the stopped state (fd100StepNumber == 0)
 - the cmd variable (for example, IV01cmd) sets the valve to one of three
   states:
     0 -> None (This causes no change in state.)
     1 -> Auto
     2 -> Manual Off
     3 -> Manual On
 - add the cmd variable to the watch window (find the variable under
   User/UserVariables)
 - turn the watch on
 - double click on the variable in the watch window
 - type the new value and press enter
 
Note that the valves require air pressure to function, and the system
DOES NOT check that there is sufficient, or even any, air pressure.
Further, note that the valve may already be in the desired state.  To
check that it is working change the state from off to on and then to
auto.  If everything is working correctly, this should change the
valve position and then return it back again to its original position.
